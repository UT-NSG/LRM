This folder contains the original codes that generate the results of the paper. 
The other folder contains newer version of code that support all the previous codes.
Use of the newer version is suggested. 
Main files are files that start with "IterOverLRM". Depending on the rest of the file's name, they run different versions of the algorithm.
To run the code:
1. Make sure the working directory is set currectly to the directory the codes are in. (See line 14).
2. Make sure you have installed the required libraries, especially LinkPrediction. (See https://github.com/galanisl/LinkPrediction/blob/master/README.md for more information).
3. Make sure you have all the required datasets.
4. Change the datasets you want to test in the file "data_spec.txt".

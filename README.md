# LRM
This repository is for sharing the associated codes of the paper "Link Prediction in Real-World Multiplex Networks via Layer Reconstruction Method", available at "https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09422".


There are two sets of codes. Using the LRM_Codes version is preferred to Original Codes.
In each folder, there a read me file explaining how to run the codes in more details.

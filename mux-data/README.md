This folder contains the datasets used in the simulations of the paper. 
Each file contains lines in the form of a b, which denotes a connection between nodes a and b. 
The function responsible for creating the network from the text file is called "form_net.R".
(see one of the files to understand how the data is represented.)
This folder should be in the same director as the folder of codes is.
